# Alice in Wonderland, in Space
CS 174A Spring 2022 Team 12 Project.

This project is a 3D rendering of a scene inspired by Alice in Wonderland, also taking place in outer space. The user will be able to navigate through the scene and observe various exhibits in different areas of the scene. In the middle room, we have displayed a tall obelisk with rotating spheres around it, representing an abstract tea party as the characters constantly move around to different seats at the table. In the bottom left room, we have a mushroom garden, in which the mushrooms are randomly generated in terms of size, position, texture, color, scaling, and rotation. In the top right room, there stands a glowing, red rabbit. The user must collect ten potions scattered randomly across the entire exhibit and give them to the red rabbit in order to cause the rabbit to glow blue. Finally, above the entire exhibit, there is a faraway solar system with orbiting planets, since this exhibit takes place in outer space.

## Running the code:
Run `python3 server.py` and navigate to `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
